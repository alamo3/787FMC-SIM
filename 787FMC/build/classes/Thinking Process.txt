HERE IS MY THINKING PROCESS FOR WHAT I WANT TO DO.
  
  
  
  
  //TODO For airways:
  PREMISE 1 WANT TO PULL WAYPOINTS FOR AIRWAYS FROM FILE. 
  IM THINKING OF USING THE ONE PROVIDED FOR PMDG BECAUSE IT SEEMS THE SIMPLEST ONE TO ME?
  
  I'VE GOT THE FILE IN. NOW I HAVE TO ACTUALLY READ FROM IT
  HOW WOULD I DO THAT?
  
  First, I want the user to actually input the airway then the exit point.
  But the problem is, I don't know know which way they want to actually go?
  I'm thinking of comparing the latitude and longitude of destination and arrival to see if its going east , west, north , or south. 
  Then I want to compare the last waypoint and the first waypoint of the airway to see if the airway is going which polar direction?
  
  I'll calculate the bearing between the two which should tell me the direction. 
  
  Then, I want to actually see if I'm moving up the airway or down the airway?
  
  That will also be accomplished by looking at the direction of the airway and the bearing between the two airports.
  Note: This might fail because I have no idea if this will actually work?
  
  If I am able to do this, I can basically import all airways
  
  
  A definite modification of the displayLegs() Method will be required.
  
  
  Alright, SO here's the scenario
  
  I get the name of the airway, mark the stream 
  

  
  HERE'S ANOTHER SCENARIO EATING MY BRAIN
  
  GET THE WAYPOINT NAME 
  SAVE IT
  IN THE NEXT LOOP IT DOESNT CHANGE
  WHEN THE LAT AND LONG OF IT ARE TAKEN THEN IT CHANGES
  
  i have a variable called taken
  
  when taken is 1, the thing changes the wpt name to the current one but if its zero, it doesnt change
  
  so i take the name of the waypoint, 
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  I DONT CARE ABOUT WHAT I WROTE BEFORE, I DID IT. THE ONLY PROBLEM WAS THAT THE RFERRENCES TO MEMORY WERE BEING ERASED SO
  ONLY THE LAST ONE FOR AIRWAY Z999 WAS BEING SAVED 
  I HAD TO CACHE THE LEGS FOR EACH EVERY AIRWAY
  THEN CACHE THE NAME FOR EACH AIRWAY
  THEN CACHE THE LAT AND LONG FOR EACH AIRWAY
  THEN ACTUALLY BRING THEM TOGETHER AND CREATE THE FINAL AIRWAY OBJECT THAT HOLDS ALL AIRWAYS
  THEN CACHE THAT AND IT FINALLY WORKS NOW :)
  
  
  
  
  //TODO: Excitement aside, now I actually have to work on implementing this into the GUI and start working on navAids  (ugh)!
  
  
  NOW I FIGURED I CAN'T REALLY IMPLEMENT RTE IN THE FMC WITHOUT ACTUALLY IMPLEMENTING NAVAIDS.... 
  
  I JUST HAVE A QUESTION: DO ALL SIDS LEAD TO A NAVAID OR NOT?
  
  WELL THEN, LET'S GET TO WORK.
  SAME CACHING PRINCIPLE FOR NAVAIDS? ITS 15K LINES. 
  NOW ALL I WANT TO KNOW IS WHAT NAVAID IS WHAT TYPE
  
  
  
  
  
  
  I'VE GOT MANY TYPES OF NAVAIDS
  ALL HAVE DIFFERNT SPECIFICATIONS. UGH!
  CREATE A SEPARATE CLASS FOR EACH NAVAID?
  
  VORS AND NDBS CAN USE ONE CLASS
  
  
  
  
  I HAVE A BASIC OF IDEA OF HOW TO IDENTIFY WHICH WAYPOINT IS WHAT TYPE USING THE NUMBERS IN THE 
  NAVIGRAPH DATABASE NOW I HAVE TO PULL IT AND STORE IT. 
  
  WHAT IF THERE IS MORE THAN ONE NAVAID WITH THE SAME NAME, THE MOST STUPID THING IS THAT THERE IS MORE THAN ONE NAVAID OF THE SAME 
  TYPE OF NAVAID AND A DIFFERENT TYPE OF NAVAID
  
  HOW WOULD I SOLVE THIS PROBLEM?
  
  
  IF I STORE ALL THE NAVAIDS IN THE WORLD (NOT INCLUDING APPROACHES AND MARKER BEACONS) I AM LEFT WITH DMES VORS AND NDBS. 
  
  NOW I LET'S SEE THE SCENARIO
  
  EVERY VOR HAS A NAME, IDENTIFIER, FREQUENCY, LATITUDE, LONGITUDE
  EVERY NDB HAS A NAME, IDENTIFIER, FREQUENCY, LATITUDE, LONGITUDE
  EVERY DME HAS A NAME, IDENTIFIER, FREQUENCY, LATITUDE, LONGITUDE
  
  
  SO HOW WOULD I PULL FROM THE THING?
  DO I REALLY NEED TO?
  WHAT IF I JUST CALL GET AND IF IT RETURNS NULLPOINTEREXCEPTION I CONCLUDE THAT THERE IS NO NAVAID WITH THAT NAME. SEEMS ABOUT RIGHT
  MUCH MORE EFFICIENT THAN ITERATING THROUGH THE ENTIRE LIST 
  
  
  BUT HOW DO I GET IT TO PULL MULTIPLE TYPES OF NAVAIDS IF THERE ARE MULTIPLE
  
  LETS THINK ABOUT THIS
  
  I HAVE AN NDB CALLED BKR
  THEN I HAVE ANOTHER NDB CALLED BKR BUT DIFFERENT NAME AND FREQUENCY
  THEN I HAVE A VOR CALLED BKR WITH A DIFFERENT NAME AND FREQUENCY
  
 I have a POJO class called navaid 
  
  IF I STORE them in a hashmap, i will not be able to store duplicates unless i mess up the equals method which i think i already have. 
  So safe to say I can store duplicates since they aren't really duplicates but just different navaids with the same identifier. 
  
  I'VE GOT TO THINK AHEAD. 
  IF I WRITE A CUSTOM GET METHOD CALLED GETNAV();
IT SHOULD BE ABLE TO FETCH ALL THE SAME KEYS 
  SO THERE IS THIS THING CALLED MULITMAP IN THE GUAVA LIBRARY WHICH I DO HAVE.
  
  
  
  
  ALRIGHT SO I HAVE THE NAVAIDS FIGURED OUT AND CACHED. 
  NOW, I NEED TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO IMPLEMENT THIS INTO THE REAL RTE GUI INTERFACE OF THE FMC. 
  I NEED TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO REMEMBER EACH RTE ENTRY MADE.
  ILL DO THAT USING A LIST 
  
  AND HOW DO I DISPLAY THE ENTRIES? WELL EASY, USING THE GET METHOD OF THE LIST. BUT HOW DO I ADD THE DASHES AND PAGE NUMBERS?
  
  SO FOR EACH NAV ENTRY ADDED, WHEN THE FIRST TWO DASHES ARE FILLED UP, THE NEXT 2 DASHES ARE SHOWN
  THIS SEEMS LIKE I WOULD BE ABLE TO DO WITH A 2D ARRAY.
  
  
  
  
  SO WHAT IM PLANNING ON DOING IS, IS TO PUT THE 2D ARRAY IN A HASHMAP FOR EACH RTE PAGE THE IS CREATED. 
  SO IF I HAVE 1 RTE PAGE, IT WILL BE <1,String[]>
  
  But how do i define which page number I'm at and how do i add a page number?
  
  So when i enter the last entry on page 1, it should create page 2. 
  
  But when I'm on page 1 again and enter the entry again, it shouldn't create a page 2 
  it should delete page 2? 
  I think it should. 
  So when i go back a page, it should be fine.
  
  Now before i do this I'll probably implement waypoints.txt as well :)
  
  
  
  OK, SO HERE'S THE DEAL, NOW I'VE IMPLEMENTED WAYPOINTS.TXT
  
  NOW, I KNOW HOW A FLIGHT PLAN IS CALCULATED.
  
  FIRST I HAVE TO GET AN ENTRY
  
  I CAN MAKE A 2D ARRAY THAT HAS DIMENSIONS 5 BY 2
  
  EVERY TIME A NEW PAGE IS CREATED, I CREATE A NEW ARRAY
  TO DO THIS, I'LL STORE IT IN A MAP AND CREATE A NEW ARRAY EACH TIME A NEW PAGE IS ADDED. 
  AND HOW DO I DISPLAY THAT PAGE?
  
  WELL, I HAVE A METHOD CALLED DISPLAYRTE();
  
  THIS METHOD SHOULD BE ABLE TO PULL ALL ENTRIES FROM FROM THE ARRAY NUMBER OF THAT PAGE. 
  THIS MEANS I'LL PROBABLY HAVE TO IMPLEMENT PAGE NUMBERS AS WELL
  SO I CHECK THE LSK6R TO CHECK IF THERE IS A LAST ENTRY THERE, THEN, IF THERE IS ONE,
    I'LL CREATE A NEW PAGE AND A NEW ARRAY, IF THERE ISN'T ONE OR IF THERE IS "----" THERE, 
    IT DOESN'T.
    
    I'LL HAVE A VARIABLE WITH MAX NUMBER OF PAGES. 
    INITIALLY IT WILL BE SET TO 1.
    THEN WHEN THE FIRST PAGE IS DONE, IT'LL INCREASE TO 2
  A NEW ARRAY WILL BE CREATED WHICH WILL LOOK LIKE THIS :
    
    
    
    [0][1]="----";
    [0][2]="----";
    
    THE REST WILL BE ="";
    
    
  IT WILL LOOK LIKE THIS IN THE MAP: (1,String[5][2]);
  
  STATUS = SUCCESFUL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
