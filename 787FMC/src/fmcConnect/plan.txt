IF I CREATE A PANELSTATE OBJECT 
  
  I WOULD HAVE HAVE MANY OBJECTS INSIDE IT
  
  FOR NOW:
  
  THERE WOULD BE 
  -IDENT
  -POS INIT
  -POS REF
  -RTE
  
  EACH OBJECT WOULD HAVE THE 10 LABELS
  
  SO IF I GET THE COMMAND FROM SIM FOR EXAMPLE:
  
  button1Pressed
  
  the FMC MAIN CLASS WOULD LOOK AT THE PANELSTATE, THEN PASS ON AN OBJECT TO THE BUTTON 1 CLASS
  
  LET'S SAY POS INIT
  POS INIT IS PASSED INTO THE METHOD 
  WHICH HAS A PARAMETER FOR A PANELSTATE OBJECT
  
  THE BUTTON CLASS TAKES THE OBJECT PASSED TO IT. THEN PASSES ITSELF AS AN OBJECT BACK TO PANELSTATE OBJECT, WHICH WOULD THEN KNOW WHICH BUTTON IS PRESSED.
  
  THE BUTTON CLASS WILL HAVE A METHOD CALLED PERFORM ACTION. WHICH WOULD TAKE THE NAME OF THE PANELSTATE, THEN PERFORM THE APPROPRIATE ACTION 
  SO WHEN LSK1L IS PRESSED ON THE FMC IN THE SIM, IT SETS DATAREF fmcComm to button1L. 
  
  The Java program will know by this that button1L is pressed on the FMC and will take the panelstate of the aircraft 
  
  So i send it to the button1L class which has a perform action method. 
  
  The perform action will then perform methods in the panelstate object 
  
  So the panelstate objects need to be shared amongst the classes.
