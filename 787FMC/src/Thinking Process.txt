HERE IS MY THINKING PROCESS FOR WHAT I WANT TO DO.
  
  
  
  
  //TODO For airways:
  PREMISE 1 WANT TO PULL WAYPOINTS FOR AIRWAYS FROM FILE. 
  IM THINKING OF USING THE ONE PROVIDED FOR PMDG BECAUSE IT SEEMS THE SIMPLEST ONE TO ME?
  
  I'VE GOT THE FILE IN. NOW I HAVE TO ACTUALLY READ FROM IT
  HOW WOULD I DO THAT?
  
  First, I want the user to actually input the airway then the exit point.
  But the problem is, I don't know know which way they want to actually go?
  I'm thinking of comparing the latitude and longitude of destination and arrival to see if its going east , west, north , or south. 
  Then I want to compare the last waypoint and the first waypoint of the airway to see if the airway is going which polar direction?
  
  I'll calculate the bearing between the two which should tell me the direction. 
  
  Then, I want to actually see if I'm moving up the airway or down the airway?
  
  That will also be accomplished by looking at the direction of the airway and the bearing between the two airports.
  Note: This might fail because I have no idea if this will actually work?
  
  If I am able to do this, I can basically import all airways
  
  
  A definite modification of the displayLegs() Method will be required.
  
  
  Alright, SO here's the scenario
  
  I get the name of the airway, mark the stream 
  

  
  HERE'S ANOTHER SCENARIO EATING MY BRAIN
  
  GET THE WAYPOINT NAME 
  SAVE IT
  IN THE NEXT LOOP IT DOESNT CHANGE
  WHEN THE LAT AND LONG OF IT ARE TAKEN THEN IT CHANGES
  
  i have a variable called taken
  
  when taken is 1, the thing changes the wpt name to the current one but if its zero, it doesnt change
  
  so i take the name of the waypoint, 
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  I DONT CARE ABOUT WHAT I WROTE BEFORE, I DID IT. THE ONLY PROBLEM WAS THAT THE RFERRENCES TO MEMORY WERE BEING ERASED SO
  ONLY THE LAST ONE FOR AIRWAY Z999 WAS BEING SAVED 
  I HAD TO CACHE THE LEGS FOR EACH EVERY AIRWAY
  THEN CACHE THE NAME FOR EACH AIRWAY
  THEN CACHE THE LAT AND LONG FOR EACH AIRWAY
  THEN ACTUALLY BRING THEM TOGETHER AND CREATE THE FINAL AIRWAY OBJECT THAT HOLDS ALL AIRWAYS
  THEN CACHE THAT AND IT FINALLY WORKS NOW :)
  
  
  //TODO: Excitement aside, now I actually have to work on implementing this into the GUI and start working on navAids  (ugh)!
