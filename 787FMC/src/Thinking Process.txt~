HERE IS MY THINKING PROCESS FOR WHAT I WANT TO DO.
  
  
  
  
  //TODO For airways:
  PREMISE 1 WANT TO PULL WAYPOINTS FOR AIRWAYS FROM FILE. 
  IM THINKING OF USING THE ONE PROVIDED FOR PMDG BECAUSE IT SEEMS THE SIMPLEST ONE TO ME?
  
  I'VE GOT THE FILE IN. NOW I HAVE TO ACTUALLY READ FROM IT
  HOW WOULD I DO THAT?
  
  First, I want the user to actually input the airway then the exit point.
  But the problem is, I don't know know which way they want to actually go?
  I'm thinking of comparing the latitude and longitude of destination and arrival to see if its going east , west, north , or south. 
  Then I want to compare the last waypoint and the first waypoint of the airway to see if the airway is going which polar direction?
  
  I'll calculate the bearing between the two which should tell me the direction. 
  
  Then, I want to actually see if I'm moving up the airway or down the airway?
  
  That will also be accomplished by looking at the direction of the airway and the bearing between the two airports.
  Note: This might fail because I have no idea if this will actually work?
  
  If I am able to do this, I can basically import all airways
  
  
  A definite modification of the displayLegs() Method will be required.
